- Parse CH data for Full, summary locations and individual trains
- A way of filtering locations (conditions for directions?)
- Sort pathing info (just delete from data?)
- Unzip .WTT files for parsing and update correctly on compile
- Category defaults/ can we determine it from the data?
- Partially ammend TT times (lower priority)



To Test
- Merging TTs
- Having no train cat
- Putting dwell times in all locations


Issues
- Sched table seems to have some bad html missing </tr> tag on header
