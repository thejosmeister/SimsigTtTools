- Parse CH data for Full, summary locations and individual trains
- A way of filtering locations (conditions for directions?)
- Sort pathing info (just delete from data?)
- Unzip .WTT files for parsing and update correctly on compile
- Category defaults/ can we determine it from the data - **Pull out all timing load, power type, speed, status combos from all trains**
- Add properties to XML parser/writer :
        for train TT:
            <ShuntPhone>-1</ShuntPhone>
      <ShuntInterpose>0</ShuntInterpose>
      <ClassOfService>3</ClassOfService>
      <CanUseGoodsLines>-1</CanUseGoodsLines>

      for train categories:
      <PowerToWeightCategory>2</PowerToWeightCategory>

- Partially ammend TT times (lower priority)




To Test
- Merging TTs - trains get brought in regardless of UID, maybe need to make my own version
- Having no train cat - Will mean template descr does not have stock
- Putting dwell times in all locations


Issues
- Sched table seems to have some bad html missing </tr> tag on header
